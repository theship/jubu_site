        <h2><strong>Lightweight implementation</strong> with appropriate tech stack</h2>
        <p>Another example of an interactive hybrid app, I challenged myself to provide components with the most efficient tools in this comparison of vaccine efficacy.

        <ul>
          <li>When implementing a design, I chose the framework with the least amount of code and the best performance for the target systems.</li>
          <li>Converted all designs to vector-based files in Sketch and Illustrator. I then added semantics to the SVGs. Behavioral changes ran through JavaScript, updating the CSS of the SVGs.

        <p>Detailed attention includes considering regulations that protect the consumer, reader, and user. Content creation always has a legal component, especially when dealing with components such as a dosing calculator. From the personally-identifiable information rules of HIPAA, through the data retention policy of GDPR, to the font size on pharmaceutical advertisements of the FDA, and on, content lifecycle requires consideration and care.</p>
